== Keycloak Adapter Policy Enforcer

You can enforce authorization decisions to your applications if you are using {{book.project.name}} OIDC Adapters.

When you enable policy enforcement to your {{book.project.name}} application, the corresponding adapter is going to intercept
every single request to your application and enforce the authorization decisions obtained from the server.

Policy enforcement is strongly based on your application's paths and the link:../resource/overview.html[Resources] you created to a resource server using the {{book.project.name}} Administration Console. By default,
when you create a resource server, {{book.project.name}} creates a link:../resource-server/default-config.html[Default Configuration] to your resource server so you can enable policy enforcement very quickly.

The default configuration allows access for every single resource in your application as long as the authenticated user belongs to the same realm as the resource server being protected.

=== Policy Enforcement Configuration

To enable policy enforcement to your application, add the following property to your *keycloak.json* file:

.keycloak.json
```json
{
  "policy-enforcer": {}
}
```
Or a little more verbose if you want to manually define the resources being protected:

```json
{
  "policy-enforcer": {
    "user-managed-access" : {},
    "enforcement-mode" : "ENFORCING"
    "paths": [
      {
        "path" : "/someUri/*",
        "methods" : [
          {
            "method": "GET",
            "scopes" : ["urn:app.com:scopes:view"]
          },
          {
            "method": "POST",
            "scopes" : ["urn:app.com:scopes:create"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name" : "Some Resource",
        "path" : "/usingPattern/{id}",
        "methods" : [
          {
            "method": "DELETE",
            "scopes" : ["urn:app.com:scopes:delete"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "path" : "/exactMatch"
      },
      {
        "name" : "Admin Resources",
        "path" : "/usingWildCards/*"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Here is a description of each configuration option:

* *policy-enforcer*
+
Specify the configuration options that define how policies are actually enforced and optionally the paths you want to protect. If empty, the policy enforcer will query the server
for all resources associated with the resource server being protected. In this case, you need to make sure the resources are properly configured with a link:../resource/create.adoc#_uri[URI] property that matches the paths
 you want to protect.
+
** *user-managed-access*
+
Tells the adapter to use the UMA protocol. If set, the adapter will ask the server for permission tickets and return them to clients accordingly with UMA specification. If not set,
the adapter will just rely on the RPT sent to the server to actually enforce permissions.
+
** *enforcement-mode*
+
Dictates how policies are enforced.
+
*** *ENFORCING*
+
This is the default mode. Requests are denied by default even when there is no policy associated with a given resource.
+
*** *PERMISSIVE*
+
Requests are allowed even when there is no policy associated with a given resource.
+
*** *DISABLED*
+
Completely disables the evaluation of policies and allow access to any resource.
+
** *on-deny-redirect-to*
+
Defines an URL to where a client request should be redirected to when an access denied message is obtained from the server. By default, the adapter responds with a 403 HTTP status code..
+
** *paths*
+
Specify the paths to protect.
+
*** *name*
+
The name of a resource in the server that must be associated with a given path. When used in conjunction with a *path*, the policy enforcer will ignore the resource's *URI* property and will use the path you provided instead.
*** *path*
+
A URI relative to the application's context path. If this option is provided, the policy enforcer will query the server for a resource with a *URI* with the same value. This option is REQUIRED.
Right now, we support some very basic logic for path matching. Examples of valid paths are:
+
**** Wildcards: `/*`
**** Suffix: `/*.html`
**** Sub-paths: `/path/*`
**** Path parameters: /resource/{id}
**** Exact match: /resource
+
*** *methods*
The HTTP methods to protect and how they are associated with the scopes for a given resource in the server.
+
**** *method*
+
The name of the HTTP method.
+
**** *scopes*
+
An array of strings with the scopes associated with the method. When you associate scopes with a specific method, the client trying to access a protected resource (or path) must provide
a RPT that grants permission to all scopes here specified.
