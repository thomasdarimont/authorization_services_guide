== Default Configuration

When you create a resource server, {{book.project.name}} creates a default configuration to your newly created resource server.

The default configuration consists of:

* A default protected resource representing all resources in your application.
* A policy that grants access only for users within the same _realm_ as the resource server.
* A permission that governs access to all resources based on the default policy.

The default protected resource is called *Default Resource* and you can see it if you click on the `Resources` tab.

This resource defines a `Type` `urn:my-resource-server:resources:default` and an `URI` `/*`. Here, the `URI` field defines a
wildcard pattern that tells {{book.project.name}} that this resource represents all the paths in your application. In other words,
when enabling link:../enforcer/overview.html[Policy Enforcement] to your application, all the permissions associated with the resource
will be checked before granting access.

The `Type` aforementioned defines a value that can be used to create link:../permission/typed-resource-permission.adoc[Typed Resource Permissions] that must be applied
to the default resource or any other resource you create using the same type.

The default policy is called *Only From Realm Policy* and you can see it if you click on the `Policies` tab.

.Default Policy

This policy is a link:../policy/js-policy.html[JavaScript-Based Policy] defining a condition that always grant access to the resources protected by this policy. If you click on this policy you'll see that it defines a rule as follows:

```js
// by default, grants any permission associated with this policy
$evaluation.grant();
```

For last, the default permission is called *Default Permission* and you can see it if you click on the `Permissions` tab.

.Default Permission

This permission is a link:../permission/overview.html[Resource-Based Permission], defining that a set of one or more policies should
 be applied to all resources with a given type.

== Post-Configuration Instructions

You are not forced to keep the default configuration if you don't want to. You can remove the default resource, policy and permission any time you want.
