== Typed Resource Permission

Resource permissions can also be used to define policies that must be applied to all resources with a given link:../resource/create.adoc#_type[Type]. This form of resource-based permission can be very handy when you have resources sharing very common access requirements and constraints.

Usually, resources within an application can be categorized (or typed) based on the data they encapsulate or the functionality they provide. For instance, a financial application manages different
banking accounts where each one belongs to a specific customer. Although they are different banking account, they usually share some very common security requirements and constraints, where those are globaly
defined by the banking organization. With typed resource permissions you may want to define some very common policies to all banking accounts:

* Only the owner can manage his account
* Only allow access from the owner's country and/or region
* Enforce a specific authentication method
* And so forth ...

To create a typed resource permission, just click on link:./create-resource.adoc#_apply_resource_type[Apply to Resource Type] when creating a new resource permissions. Once you do that,
you should be able to specify the type that you want to protect as well the policies that must be applied in order to govern access to all resources with type you have provided.
