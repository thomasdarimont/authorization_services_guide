== Creating Scope-based Permissions

A Scope-based permission defines a set of one or more scopes to protect using a set of one or more authorization policies. Unlike the resource-based permissions, this permission type
allows you to create permissions not only for a resource, but also for the scopes associated with it, providing more granularity when defining the permissions that govern your resources and the
actions that can be performed on them.

To create a new permission select the option *Scope-based* in the dropdown located in the right upper corner of the permission listing.
